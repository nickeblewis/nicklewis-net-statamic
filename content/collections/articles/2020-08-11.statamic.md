Over time I have wanted to return to working on Laravel and PHP, having spent a lot of time working with JavaScript frameworks such as React, AngularJS, .NET but for me as soon as I began learning about Laravel... I had to learn more and more. I love it. It rocks and I want to build more cool stuff with a combination of Laravel on the back-end and VueJS on the front.

Enter Statamic...
